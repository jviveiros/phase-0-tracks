##Input elements of a form
1. <form> - This seems to be the first piece of the form and needs to have a name and an action method (not sure what this is yet).
2. <fieldset> seems to encapsulate all the different fields within the form. 
3. <div> seems to create a division on the page.
4. <label> seems to label the particular field of a form.
5. <input> Looks to be a place where you create a field to gather user input. 
6. inline element 'type' seems to set the type of input and the 'name' seems to be what we want to call this data that's collected.
7. another inline element I see is 'placeholder' which seems to pre-populate a field with a sample input.
8. <option> seems to give an option  under the <select> heading for a selection form. Strangely this one doesn't seem to be tied to an input command. It must be because the user can't input anything just can <select> something.
9. <button type ="submit"> creates a button with a name that works as a submit button.

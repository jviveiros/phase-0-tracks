##Elevator Algorithm

-Ask which floor an individual wants to travel to upon entering the elevator
-Begin Elevator instruction set
	-Wait 3 seconds
	-Close Doors
	-go from the lowest floor given to the highest. E.G if you received orders for floor 4, 12, 2, and 17. Go to the floors in ascending order: 2,4,12,17. When starting at the ground floor. When starting at the top do descending order.
	-At each floor open the doors and wait for individuals to exit or enter the elevator.
	-Upon exit of  the last rider, return to the ground floor only if no one called the elevator from another floor.
		-If someone called an elevator go to that floor, open doors, wait three seconds and go to the floor they instructed.
-Elevator should work on a first come - first served basis. If instructions are given before on a different floor than rider then finish the ride before moving to the next passenger.
-Repeat

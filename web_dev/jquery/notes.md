##Plan of Attack on JQuery

1. Brush up on my javascript syntax as I'm sure that JQuery will use this.
2. Learn about JQuery's general capabilities and use cases. 
3. Find a great JQuery cheatsheet and bookmark that!
4. Read some of the book I bought called JavaScript & JQuery and how the two go hand in hand.
5. Look for common functions in JavaScript that have been provided in JQuery.
6.Learn what I need to install on my machine to use JQuery.
7. Search the interwebs for Jquery snippets and samples.


##Efficacy of my Plan
1. Reading from the book was probably the least efficient but it gave me that high level understanding of what Jquery is and how to use it.
2. Learning the syntax may take a little time because it's not like human language like Ruby but it does have a nice simplicity to it.
3. I'm going to dive into a project and update the previous project to use jquery to change the html on a page instead of vanilla Js.

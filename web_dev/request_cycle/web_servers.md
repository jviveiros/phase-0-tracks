##In Your Own words, what is a VPS? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
1. Based on my understanding a VPS is a Virtual Private Server that an individual alone, or maybe a family, could access. I like to think the advantages of using a virtual private server is anonymity, back-up/security of being able to store data on a different server other than your local machine or on github. They also can easily be created and configured and are very cheap compared to a physical server (even though they live on physical servers :/)


##Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a linux system?
1. Because if something is built in root and it gets hacked or accessed an individual can have super-user access and basically do anything down to the kernel.
